		<p>
		MeetingsApp is a web-based application for individuals or groups to sync their calendars and organise meetings.
  The application allows users to organize meetings and invite people to take part in it. 
  If a meeting is marked as important and someone won't be able to participate, 
  the person would have to write an excuse to the organiser. There will also be an option
  to post the length of the meeting to everyone who was invited to it.
